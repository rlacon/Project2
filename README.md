# Group Project 2 - Game Matcher
Game Matcher is an application I worked on with three other members of my cohort. After the user logs in or creates an account, they will select four video games they like from a table. The application will match them with other users in the database and recommend new games for them to play based on what others have selected. We originally intended to create a matching algorithm where it would only match users with similar games in common, but this was a bigger undertaking than we thought. We had a week to complete the project so now it will select another user at random and return their selection of games to the user.

# My Role
I primarily worked on the frontend styling the UI and getting the table working by populating it with real data. We found a spreadsheet online containing raw video game data and fed it into our MySQL database. We then used Sequelize to fill that data dynamically on the page.

# Wireframes
I designed the userflow and general look and feel of the application by creating wireframes. I turned these wireframes into a clickable prototype to demonstrate to my team how the app would work: https://invis.io/KATEXAIXQTP. My team used these mockups as a basis to code out the other screens and features.
